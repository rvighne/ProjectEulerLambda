# Project Euler Solutions &mdash; Functional Style

My own solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) math/computer science problems. Unlike [my other repo](https://github.com/rvighne/ProjectEuler) in C++, these solutions are in Haskell and using a functional style of programming. They are by no means optimal, but reflect my own learning process, and hopefully you find them to be an interesting application of functional programming.
